# Remote Attestations on IoT Devices
This directory contains remote attestation apps for SEDIMENT supported devices.

Resources and documentations for each supported device are contained in its own directory. Shared resources are contained in the 'common' directory or the shared platform, e.g. 'zephyr'. To run a linux device, use the instructions for RPi.

- [zephyr - Zephyr Devices](zephyr/README.md) This currently includes the Silicon Labs Giant Gecko.
- [rpi - Raspberry Pi Zero W](rpi/README.md) This applies to both Linux (Ubuntu) PC and Raspberry Pi's.
